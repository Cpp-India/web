## Who are we?

`#include <C++>` is a global, inclusive, and diverse community for developers interested in C++. Here, you can find a welcoming space to learn and discuss C++. We also provide resources to create safer, more inclusive, community gatherings.

Our goal is a more welcoming and inclusive C++ community, as expressed in conferences, the committee, industry and so on. We work hard both to make these changes, and to support others such as [conference organisers](), who share our goals.

We believe that a community is only as good as how it treats its most vulnerable members. Therefore, we strive to create a welcoming, safe, and accessible environment. We have a strong [Code of Conduct]().

Our primary communication platform is our [Discord server](). Join us to discuss and learn C++ in a welcoming, inclusive space.

The moderation and administration team includes [Patricia Aas]().

Everyone who supports our goals, whether a member of any under-represented groups or not, is welcome to participate in any way - see [What can I do?]() Many of our leaders and contributors are allies and we are grateful for all they do. If you want C++ to be more welcoming and inclusive, you'll be welcomed and included.

You can find out more from Sy Brand's DevRelCon London 2019 talk ["Lessons learned creating an inclusive space in a decades old community"]().
