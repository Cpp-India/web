**Ankur Satle** is an **Architect** working on **Telecom products** at EXFO. He has extensive experience in high-performance VoIP, 3G/4G protocols, Network Monitoring, OSS/BSS systems. He strongly recommends building functionality as libraries - build once and use everywhere. He can often find him talking about the importance of implementations that are `easy-to-use-correctly`, `correct-by-construction`, and `minimalistic-that-enables-change`. Distributed Architecture, Cloud Technologies and DevOps fascinate him. He is a B. Tech. in Electronics and Telecom and a Post-graduate Diploma in Software Technology. An engineer at heart, he has a strong focus on optimisation, using less resources and minimalism. No wonder, C++ is his favourite tool. He has a multi-codebase modernisation experience. 

He loves learning languages - natural languages :). He has a fair grip on a few Indian languages and is currently learning French. A father of two, he loves outdoor activities and talking about cosmology with children. He loves playing football and watching thrillers & mystery movies. He is constantly learning something or the other, you may often find. 

If you attended any CppIndia Tech-Talk, you will find him there hosting and sharing his thoughts. He is an active Organizer, Presenter and Maintainer at CppIndia. You can check out his talks from Cppcon 2020 and CppIndia on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=ankur+satle).
