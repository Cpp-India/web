## How to sponsor CppIndia

Sponsoring CppIndia means most likely to host one of our events and provide some platform. All we need is a platform for presentations and some goodies for the social part of the event.
If you would like to sponsor an event, but do not have a suitable platform, contact us anyway. Very likely we can help in that
Our events happen on alternate Saturday at 11:00 AM IST(online, we started in 2020. Hope you understand).


## Why sponsoring a CppIndia

CppIndia has a long-term mission to serve the needs of C++ developers in India and we are interested in partnering with companies that share that long-term vision.
Supporting and sponsoring CppIndia delivers value to companies in our community in a number of ways.

Value directly to companies that sponsor or have employees speak:

    **Recruitment**: Nothing makes a company more attractive to community members when considering employment options than to see long-term community support as a sponsor and to see knowledgeable speakers from that company talking about tackling challenging issues in interesting ways.
    **Image and awareness**: Members will gain a favorable impression of sponsoring companies and companies with knowledgeable employees speaking.
    **Product exposure**: Swag opportunities and presentations expose members to new products and ideas.
    **Community influence**: Presenting provides the opportunity to influence community thinking about tools, processes, libraries, and features.
    **Giving back**: Sponsoring is a great way to support the community and be seen doing so.

## Value to employees as attendees or speakers:

    **Better training**: Employees that attend are better informed about best practices and new features and tools.
    **Better engagement**: Employees that attend have higher morale and are excited about applying what they've learned.
    **Develop expertise**: Researching a topic for a presentation is a valuable learning experience.
    **Better leaders**: Employees that participate as group speakers or organizers are learning leadership skills not always available in their regular roles.
